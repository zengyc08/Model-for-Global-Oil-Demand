# A Model to Predict Oil Demand with Global GDP and Brent Oil Price

## Installation
%%bash\
git clone https://github.com/zengyc08/Model-for-Global-Oil-Demand.git \
cd your-repo

## Project Motivations
- Visualize global oil demand growth over the years with other economic parameters e.g. GDP, Population, Urbanization, Oil Price, etc.
- Develop a linear regression model to correlate global oil demand with global GDP and Brent Oil Price
- The model can be used to predict future oil demand given assumptions on global GDP growth and Brent futures price

## File Descriptions

- World Oil Demand.csv              This is the raw data for the model
- Gloabl_Oil_Demand_Model.ipynb     This the main code to visualize historic trends and to develop linear regression model 

## How to Interact with my project
After cloning the repository in your local place, run the Gloabl_Oil_Demand_Model.ipynb in Jupyter notebook kernel by kernel. The coefficients from the linear regression model can be used for prediction of future global oil demand
